# Ask Me Anything

A repository to ask [@acch](https://github.com/acch) anything. If you have a
question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just
the joint for you.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/acch/ama/issues/new?assignees=acch&template=contact-form.md)
on this repository.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry â€” if you have any
further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel
free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the
[closed issues](https://github.com/acch/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter
